Package: yolanda
Title: General Purpose Functions
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Jared",
           family = "Felice",

           email = "jared.felice@icloud.com")
Description: This package is for general use.  There are several 
 functions that are simply extensions of base operations like grep and paste, 
 and others that make life easier such as the 'fmt_' functions and mapping 
 functions.  Without them, life is harder, which makes me angry.  Thus the
 name.  Yolanda is the character in 'Pulp Fiction' who stands up in a 
 restaurant appearing particularly upset.  It's also the alter ego of 2 year
 old daughter.
